You are sitting in the co-pilot chair of a Douglas A-20 Havoc, soaring over Antarctica’s icy expanse. Clara pilots beside you, and you hold Admiral Byrd’s diary.

DESCRIBE:
The cockpit is tight and utilitarian, filled with glowing dials and humming switches. Through the windshield, Antarctica’s endless snow glitters under a gray sky. Turbulence occasionally rocks the plane, rattling the controls. Before the control panel, next to you, on the pilot's seat is CLARA, bravely piloting the plane. On the panel sits the RADIO, and Byrd's DIARY rests on your lap.

HINT:
"I need to find something to pass the time."

EXAMINE DIARY:
*It is open on the coordinates*
"There must be some truth in it"

EXAMINE RADIO:
*The radio has a frequency adjuster*
"Maybe I could run into something interesting by switching frequencies."

HINT (after examining the radio):
"I could USE the radio to pass some time."

TALK TO CLARA:
Clara glances over: "So, doc, what’s your take? Are we on a wild goose chase, or is there really something out here in this frozen wasteland?"
    TELL 1: "Byrd’s diary points to 70°S, 10°E. The coordinates are too specific to be nothing."
    Clara: "Specific or not, Antarctica’s a maze. Let’s hope those coordinates don’t lead us straight into trouble."
    TELL 2: "I don’t know, but the weather’s turning ugly. We need to stay sharp."
    Clara: "Yeah, I feel it too. This storm’s got teeth. Keep your eyes peeled."
    TELL 3: "Whether it’s real or not, the mission’s worth it for the discovery alone."
    Clara: "Discovery’s great until the ice swallows us whole. Still, I like your optimism."

USE RADIO:
You playfully switch frequencies.

Clara: "What is it, doc? Are you bored?"
You: "Kind of."

After a while, you run into something. The radio spits static until a garbled voice breaks through.

Clara: "Wait, what? I think I hear German, but the audio is too distorted; I can’t make out the words."
    TELL 1: "Nah, you’re freaking out; that’s just some usual anomalies. Focus on piloting."
    Clara: "Yeah, you’re right; there’s no time for that."
    TELL 2: "Oh, you know German? I should have guessed from your surname."
    Clara: "Yes, my father was a German immigrant. He went to the USA when WWI started."
        TELL 1: "Byrd’s diary doesn’t mention Germans, but hey, we’re in what Nazi Germany claimed as their territory in Antarctica."
        Clara: "I’m sure the last thing we want is for my German to come in handy. This whole mission feels unreal and ridiculous."
        TELL 2: "Ah, Uncle Sam, a shelter for all the world’s people in need."
        Clara: "Until he sends you on a mission like this, haha."

After a moment you saw a confusion on Clara's face.

HINT:
"I should talk to Clara"

TALK TO CLARA:
You: "Is everything okay?"
Clara: "I don’t know; the compass and the altimeter suddenly started going crazy, but we’re close to our destination, so it shouldn’t be a problem—"

Suddenly, turbulence slams the plane. Lights flicker, instruments fail, and the engines choke.

Clara (shouting): "Brace yourself! Everything’s shutting down!"
You (screaming in panic): "Ahh, what’s happening!?"

The plane spirals down, crashing into the ice. Darkness falls.

(Action stops; player must enter DESCRIBE or HINT.)

HINT:
"I should try to DESCRIBE my surroundings to get my bearings."

DESCRIBE:
You wake amid the wreckage, cold seeping into your bones. The PLANE is a ruin, and Clara lies injured nearby. Twisted metal juts from the snow, half-burying the PLANE; engine debris burns nearby. Wind howls, stinging your face with ice. CLARA slumps a few feet away, blood staining the snow beneath her head.

EXAMINE CLARA / TALK TO CLARA:
She’s unconscious, her forehead gashed, her breathing shallow. She bleeds from her leg.

HINT:
"Clara needs help fast, and the wreckage of the PLANE might have something useful."

EXAMINE PLANE:
The plane’s a lost cause, but the luggage COMPARTMENT is intact. The supplies you took are probably still there.

HINT:
"Clara needs help fast, and a MEDKIT should be in the PLANE."

TAKE MEDKIT (after examining the plane or examining luggage compartment):
(If taken in Act 1):
Takes MEDKIT.
"Thank God I took it."
(If not taken):
You realize you forgot to take the MEDKIT before departure.
"How could I forget it? What can I do now?" You start to panic, gasping heavily. "Clara, Clara, wake up!"
You try to rouse Clara, but it’s futile.
(crying) "Clara, please, I can’t do this alone."
With her wound untreated, Clara continues to bleed. Suddenly, her heart stops beating. As the cold overwhelms you, the Antarctic claims you both.
GAME OVER (Start from the beginning or from the previous act.)
USE MEDKIT:
You bandage her wound, and she stirs awake.

Clara (mumbling): "…what happened? Where are we?"

You: "Thank God, you’re alive. We crashed, and you’re injured, but I think you’ll be okay."

Clara: "Thanks, doc… I thought I was a goner there."

HINT:
"I should check the luggage COMPARTMENT for the rest of the supplies."

EXAMINE COMPARTMENT:
Gives you a list of taken items.

TAKE FOOD:
"Essential for survival. I don’t plan on starving out there." Takes FOOD.

TAKE WATER:
"Dehydration is just as dangerous as the cold." Takes WATER.

TAKE GEIGER:
"If we’re dealing with something unnatural, this might be useful." Takes GEIGER counter.

TAKE RADIO:
"If we lose contact, this might be our only way to call for help." Takes RADIO.

TAKE CLIMBING GEAR:
"If we have to scale ice walls or descend into caves, we’ll need this." Takes CLIMBING GEAR.

TAKE NAVIGATION TOOLS:
"We can’t afford to get lost." Takes NAVIGATION TOOLS.

DROPPING ITEMS:
DROP FOOD:
"I hope we won’t regret this." Drops FOOD.
DROP WATER:
"Maybe there’s another source where we’re headed." Drops WATER.
DROP GEIGER:
"If there’s nothing radioactive, it’s just extra weight." Drops GEIGER counter.
DROP RADIO:
"We’ll just have to rely on good old-fashioned shouting." Drops RADIO.
DROP CLIMBING GEAR:
"Hopefully, no steep cliffs on this trip." Drops CLIMBING GEAR.
DROP NAVIGATION TOOLS:
"Maybe we won’t need these." Drops NAVIGATION TOOLS.
USE RADIO (if held):
No signal to base, but switching channels catches German again: "Herr [distortion], wann ist die Glocke fertig? Ich denke, wir [distortion] die Arbeit nächste Woche been…" can be heard between the static noise.

HINT:
"I should talk to Clara about that."

TALK TO CLARA:
You: "Hey Clara, did you hear that? What was that?!"

Clara: "It’s patchy, but it sounds like they were talking about building something. ‘Glocke’ means ‘bell.’ What’s a bell doing out here?"

TELL 1: "Could be code for something bigger."
Clara: "I really don’t want to know what that is. This whole thing frightens me. What the hell are Germans doing here?"
TELL 2: "Maybe it’s tied to Byrd’s mission."
Clara: "I’m getting fed up with that maniac."
TELL 3: "Let’s not jump to conclusions yet."
Clara: "What the hell are Germans doing here? But okay, you’re right; we should stay sharp."
You: "Okay, but where the hell are we?"
HINT:
"DESCRIBING my surroundings should help."

DESCRIBE:
The crash site aligns with Byrd’s coordinates. Nearby, a vast cave gapes in the ice, its edges too smooth to be natural. The cave looms like a hangar carved into the ice, its perfect edges eerie and artificial. Snow whips around, but the opening promises shelter.

HINT:
"I should talk to Clara."

EXAMINE PLANE:
"The fuselage is shredded, engines dead. We’re not flying out."

EXAMINE CAVE:
"This isn’t natural—someone or something shaped it."

TALK TO CLARA:
Clara: "We can’t stay exposed out here. That CAVE might be our only shot, but it’s giving me a bad feeling. We must GO now, before it gets dark."

GO CAVE:
You step toward the entrance, driven by cold and curiosity.

DESCRIBE (automatically):
The cave twists downward, its walls polished and warm. A hum vibrates the air, and strange discoveries await. Smooth, spiraling walls funnel you deeper. The air warms as you go, and faint lights pulse below.

HINT:
"I should talk to Clara."

TALK TO CLARA:
Clara: "Hey, what’s that? Do you see it?"

On the right side of the tunnel, you see a disk-shaped WRECK. A massive, saucer-like craft embedded in the ice, its metallic surface scarred and dented. It looks futuristic yet ancient.

EXAMINE WRECK (Upon discovery):
A disk-shaped craft protrudes from the ice, marked with a Nazi Balkenkreuz and "Hergestellt in Deutschland. 1944. Danzig." Machine gun nests bristle from its surface.

Clara: "Made in Germany. 1944. Danzig. I think that’s Nazi tech—what’s it doing here?"

HINT (if you have a geiger counter):
"I think taking the geiger counter wasn't the bad idea"

USE GEIGER COUNTER (If taken):
It ticks softly near the wreck. You: "Low radiation. Could’ve been nuclear-powered."
Clara: "That's odd, from what I know nazis never discovered nuclear energy"

HINT:
"I should talk to clara"

TALK TO CLARA:
You: "This is incredible. A Nazi flying saucer?"
Clara: "Looks like it. But how did it get here? And why?"
You: "Maybe they were experimenting with advanced technology in Antarctica."
Clara: "Or maybe they found something here. Either way, it’s creepy."
Clara: "Do you think we should try to get inside it or don't risk and GO DEEPER?"

HINT:
"I must decide, should I GO to WRECK or GO DEEPER?"

GO WRECK:
You and Clara enter the wreck through its hatch.

DESCRIPTION (automatically):
The interior is cramped and dark, with control panels covered in dust and frost. Wires hang loosely, and a faint smell of oil lingers. On a seat, you spot an old German PISTOL—a Mauser C96—still holstered.

TAKE PISTOL:
You take the Mauser pistol.

"This might come in handy."

HINT:
"I should talk to Clara."

TALK TO CLARA:
Clara: "This place gives me the creeps. Look at these controls—they’re way ahead of their time."

You: "Yeah, it’s like something out of science fiction. But it’s real."

Clara: "I think we’ve seen enough. Let’s keep moving; there might be more ahead. We should GO DEEPER"

GO DEEPER:
You press onward, but if you skip examining the wreck, Clara stops you (only examining, you can skip the entrance):

Clara: "Hold up, doc. We can’t ignore this—it’s too weird." (Prompts EXAMINE WRECK.)

DESCRIPTION (automatically):
As you descend deeper into the tunnel, a roar shakes the walls as a bat-winged aircraft rockets past, vanishing higher, toward the outside world.

Clara: "That’s Nazi design—straight out of the war!"

You: "I’m freaking out; let’s get out of here. I think I see light ahead."

A steady glow blooms from the tunnel’s depths, pulling you forward.
